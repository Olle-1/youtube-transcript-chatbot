# Multi-Tenancy Implementation Summary & Next Steps

This document explains the recent code changes made to implement multi-tenancy and outlines the necessary next steps to fully activate and test the system.

## The Goal: Why Multi-Tenancy?

The main goal was to modify the application so it can serve multiple distinct users or groups (called "tenants") from a single backend codebase. Each tenant should have an isolated experience, using their own specific configurations (like API keys for external services) and potentially seeing only their own data in the future.

## The Core Change: Tenant ID in JWT Tokens

The fundamental change was to embed a `tenant_id` within the JSON Web Token (JWT) that users receive upon successful login. This `tenant_id` acts like a label identifying which tenant the user belongs to. The backend middleware inspects this `tenant_id` on subsequent requests to load the correct context and ensure isolation.

## Summary of Code Changes Implemented

1.  **Login Endpoint Refactoring (`api.py`, `crud/user_crud.py`):**
    *   Replaced the placeholder/fake login system with real database authentication.
    *   The `/auth/token` endpoint now uses the new `authenticate_user` function to verify credentials against the `users` table in the database.
    *   Upon successful authentication, the user's `tenant_id` is retrieved from the database.
    *   The `create_access_token` function is called to generate a JWT, now including the user's `tenant_id` in the token's payload.

2.  **Database Model Update (`models/db_models.py`):**
    *   Added a `tenant_id` column to the `User` SQLAlchemy model. This column includes a foreign key constraint referencing the `tenants.id` column and is indexed for performance.

3.  **Database Migration Generation (`alembic/versions/a37f538b1088_...py`):**
    *   Successfully generated a new Alembic migration script using `railway run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add tenant_id to User model"`. This script contains the necessary instructions to add the `tenant_id` column, index, and foreign key to the `users` table in the actual database.

4.  **JWT Generation Update (`auth/utils.py`):**
    *   Modified the `create_access_token` function to accept an optional `tenant_id` argument and include it as a claim in the JWT payload if provided.

5.  **Token Verification/Middleware (`app.py`, `auth/dependencies.py`, `api.py`):**
    *   Verified that the existing `tenant_middleware` in `app.py` correctly decodes the JWT, extracts the `tenant_id`, fetches the `Tenant` object from the database, and attaches it to `request.state.tenant`. No changes were needed in the middleware itself.
    *   Confirmed the `get_current_user` dependency in `auth/dependencies.py` correctly uses JWT decoding.
    *   Updated the `/users/me` endpoint in `api.py` to use the `get_current_user` dependency, ensuring it's protected and works with the new JWT authentication.

6.  **Alembic Configuration Fixes (`alembic/env.py`, `models/db_models.py`):**
    *   Resolved multiple connection errors encountered when running `alembic revision --autogenerate` by:
        *   Ensuring `alembic/env.py` uses a synchronous database engine connection suitable for Alembic commands.
        *   Configuring `alembic/env.py` to prioritize the `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable (for cross-project Railway connections) over `DATABASE_URL`.
        *   Adjusting `models/db_models.py` to correctly handle database URL prefixes (`postgresql://` vs `postgresql+psycopg://`) for both synchronous and asynchronous engine creation.
        *   Determining that `railway run ...` is the most reliable way to execute Alembic commands that need database connectivity, as it uses the environment variables provided by Railway.

7.  **Environment Cleanup (`.env`):**
    *   Removed the obsolete `DATABASE_URL` entry pointing to `localhost` from the local `.env` file to prevent future confusion.

## Practical Differences After Implementation

*   **Login:** Users log in as before, but the JWT they receive now contains their assigned `tenant_id`.
*   **API Requests:** For requests requiring authentication and tenant context (like `/chat/stream`), the backend middleware automatically identifies the tenant from the JWT's `tenant_id`. It then loads that specific tenant's configuration (e.g., Pinecone keys/index, system prompt) from the database. This ensures the correct settings are used for processing the request.
*   **Foundation for Data Isolation:** Linking users to tenants via `tenant_id` in the database is the first step towards ensuring users only see data relevant to their tenant in the future.

## Required Next Steps (Manual Actions)

The code changes are complete, but the system requires these manual steps to become fully operational:

1.  **Deploy Code:**
    *   **Action:** Commit all the code changes (in `api.py`, `app.py`, `models/db_models.py`, `crud/user_crud.py`, `auth/utils.py`, `alembic/env.py`, `.env`, and the new migration file in `alembic/versions/`) using Git. Push these commits to your main GitHub branch.
    *   **Wait:** Allow Railway to automatically build and deploy the new version of your `robust-joy` application service. Monitor the deployment logs in the Railway dashboard.

2.  **Apply Database Migration:**
    *   **Action:** Once the deployment is successful, connect to your application's container shell using the Railway CLI:
        ```bash
        railway shell
        ```
        (Ensure you are linked to the `robust-joy` project).
    *   Inside the shell, run the Alembic command to update the database schema:
        ```bash
        alembic upgrade head
        ```
    *   **Result:** This executes the instructions in the `a37f538b1088_...py` migration file, adding the `tenant_id` column, index, and foreign key to the `users` table in your `sunny-smile` PostgreSQL database.

3.  **Assign Tenants to Users:**
    *   **Action:** Your existing users need to be linked to their respective tenants.
        *   Identify the `id` of the tenant(s) you want to assign users to.
        *   Connect to your PostgreSQL database (e.g., using `railway connect` or a GUI tool like DBeaver/pgAdmin connected via the `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`).
        *   For each user, run an SQL `UPDATE` command:
            ```sql
            UPDATE users
            SET tenant_id = 'the_actual_tenant_id' -- Replace with the correct tenant ID string
            WHERE email = 'user_email_to_update@example.com'; -- Replace with the user's email
            ```
    *   **Result:** Users in the database are now associated with specific tenants.

4.  **Test Thoroughly:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Log in via your frontend or API client as a user who has been assigned a `tenant_id`.
        *   Decode the received JWT (e.g., using jwt.io) and confirm the `tenant_id` claim is present and correct.
        *   Test API endpoints that rely on tenant context (like `/chat/stream`). Verify that the correct tenant-specific configurations (e.g., system prompt, Pinecone index specified in the `Tenant` database entry) are being used.
        *   If possible, test with users from different tenants to ensure configurations are correctly switched and isolated.
        *   Test the `/users/me` endpoint to ensure basic JWT authentication is working.
    *   **Result:** Confirmation that the multi-tenant authentication and context loading are functioning correctly.
